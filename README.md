# Grocery List

## Setup

- Install dependencies `yarn install`
- Run tests `yarn run test`
- Start local server `yarn run start`, navigate to `localhost:3000`

## With more time;

- Setup database backing rather than in-memory data store loaded from json file
- Implement delete functionality for list items in react components
- Mock up datastore for list-model tests rather than test against in-memory json file
- Clean up functionality, eg; update list size when items are added
